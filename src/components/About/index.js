            <h3>About the Events</h3>
            <p>
              Our project is currently focused on federal elected officials. We
              strongly believe that state legislatures deserve attention and
              citizen engagement, but at the moment these events are outside our
              current mission.
            </p>

            <p>Our event listing includes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Town halls</li>
              <li>
                Other public events with members of Congress in their
                district/state
              </li>
              <li>Ticketed events in the district/state</li>

                Inappropriate events to ask policy questions (e.g. funerals)

            <h3>What to expect</h3>
            <p>
              The most powerful thing you can do, as a constituent, is ask an
              earnest, pressing question on an issue close to you.
              <strong>Your personal story is incredibly valuable.</strong> It’s
              precisely how sometimes dry policy is connected with the lives of
              real people. It’s not always easy to speak up, but these times
              call for courage in all of us. Take the mic and tell your
              representative why she or he needs to act in your best interest.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Town Hall Project strongly encourages you to only attend and
              ask questions of your own representatives. Remember that any town
              hall has limited time, and a question you take is one less
              question for a constituent.

            <h3>Why Town Halls</h3>
            <p>
              There is no better way to influence your representatives than
              in-person conversations. Town halls are a longstanding American
              tradition--where our elected representatives must listen and
              respond to the concerns of their constituents. Remember: you are
              their boss.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe every citizen, no matter the party of their members of
              Congress, should have the opportunity to speak with his or her
              representatives.
            </p>
            <p>
              You have more power than you think. Town halls are one of the most
              effective ways to use it.
            </p>

            <h3>Our Supporters</h3>
            <p>
              Town Hall Project is possible because of the hard work of
              researchers, organizers, and developers across country, and the
              generous support of hundreds of grassroots donors.

                  At the beginning of 2017, a small group of fellow organizers
                  and activists gathered together to build a single public
                  database of all public events by members of Congress. We
                  believed that congressional town halls would play an
                  enormously important role in this chapter of our democracy,
                  but were surprised to discover just how difficult information
                  about these events was to find.

                  We are transparent that the bulk of Town Hall Project staff
                  and volunteers share largely progressive policy views. We make
                  no secret of our work of other progressive organizations and

                  And we will call out “Missing Members” (those who refuse to
                  hold town halls) of all parties.

                  We encourage all Americans, regardless of partisan leanings,

                  everything in between, every single member of Congress will
                  represent their constituents better by listening to them.
