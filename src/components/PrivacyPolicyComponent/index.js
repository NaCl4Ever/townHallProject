          <h3>What Personal Information Do We Collect?</h3>
          <p>
            Active Collection: Personal information may be collected in a number of ways when you visit our Sites. We
            collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us, such as if you join our email list, make a donation, fill
            out a form, connect through a social feed, sign up to be a volunteer, use a tool on a Site or request
            information. Such information may include personal information, such as your name, mailing address, email address, phone
            number, and credit card information. We may also collect demographic information you may voluntarily provide from
            time to time, such as in response to questionnaires, surveys, and interactive tools such as calculators,
            including gender, ethnicity, education, income and interest information.
          </p>
          <p>
            If this information is tied to personally identifiable information, it will be treated as personal
            information. Personal and demographic information may also be collected if you provide such information in connection
            with creating a profile or group, leaving comments, posting social media comments or other content, sending an
            email or message to another user, or participating in any interactive forums or features on the Sites. In
            addition, from time to time we may collect demographic, contact or other personal information you provide in
            connection with your participation in surveys, sweepstakes, games, promotions and other activities on the Sites. We may
            also obtain information from other sources and combine that with information we collect on our Sites. This
            information is not stored with any personally identifiable information you voluntarily provide.
          </p>
          <p>Passive Collection: When you use the Sites, some information is also automatically collected, such as your

            site, and your activity on our Sites. If you access the Sites from a mobile device, we may also collect
            information about the type of mobile device you use and the type of mobile Internet browsers you use. We treat this
            information as personal information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned
            above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only.
